# The-Need-for-Speed
This non-coding research project explores the relationship between the approach velocity of a roller coaster car entering a circular roller coaster built by myself and the energy losses incurred as the loop is traversed. The research question addressed is “how does the approach velocity affect the energy dissipation within a circular roller coaster loop?”.
